Key Points:
- The Neoproterozoic Katangan basin developed between three craton margins, within what is today mapped as an elliptical zone of lithosphere, 140-170 km thick.
- Basin stratigraphy and structure proves crustal extension by rifting drove basin formation and increased dramatically from basin margins to a Central Rift Zone.
- Eo-Cambrian inversion of the basin, most intensely along the Central Rift Zone, reactivated rift structures and created potential pathways for metallic brines.
